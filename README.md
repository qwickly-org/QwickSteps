# QwickSteps - Learn the Qwickly keyboard layout in 4 easy steps

Easier to learn than Minimak, faster than Dvorak, and your shortcuts stay put.

## QwickStep 1

Let's get the 8 most [frequently occurring letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency) in home finger positions. `A` and `S` are already there.

Swap frequently occurring letters: `E`, `T`, `N`, `I`, `O`, `P`<br/>
with letters above or below them: `D`, `F`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `;`

*(`R` occurs more than `P` but we'll get it in the next step.)*
```
 Q   W  (D)  R  (F)  Y   U  (K) (L) (;)  [   ]   \

  A   S  (E) (T)  G   H  (N) (I) (O) (P)  '   enter

   Z   X   C   V   B   (J)  M   ,   .   /

Legend
    same as QWERTY
( ) same finger as QWERTY
```
The keys `ASET GH NIOP` uses the same fingers' muscle-memory from QWERTY, only staying much more frequently on the home row.<br/>
With this layout, you may often miss `DF JKL` but that's okay since the letter you want is immediately next to the miss it's super-quick to correct. We are mostly learning the home row, so don't worry too much about the misses.

Even with these same-finger-only changes, if you look at the bottom of the page, you can see how much of an improvement this is over the standard QWERTY layout! Of course you already knew because you could feel how much smoother typing is getting.

Move on to **QwickStep 2** as soon as you can handle it (sometime before getting fully comfortable).

## QwickStep 2

Let's put that `R` on the home row where it belongs. Shift the `O` right, bumping `P` that shifts `F` left to where `R` was.
```
 Q   W  (D) (F) <P>  Y   U  (K) (L) (;)  [   ]   \

  A   S  (E) (T)  G   H  (N) (I) <R> [O]  '   enter

   Z   X   C   V   B   (J)  M   ,   .   /

Legend
    same as QWERTY
( ) same finger as QWERTY
[ ] same hand as QWERTY
< > other hand than QWERTY
```

The home row is now looking really good, and other keys are moving to their final places so we don't have to relearn much as we go.
Switch to **QwickStep 3** as soon as you can handle it, or sooner to test out the waters.

## QwickStep 3

Now we want to lock down the place of the vowel `U`. Shift `D` right, bumping `F` to where `U` was.
```
 Q   W  <U> [D] <P>  Y  <F> (K) (L) (;)  [   ]   \

  A   S  (E) (T)  G   H  (N) (I) <R> [O]  '   enter

   Z   X   C   V   B   (J)  M   ,   .   /

Legend
    same as QWERTY
( ) same finger as QWERTY
[ ] same hand as QWERTY
< > other hand than QWERTY
```

Now we've got most of the keys in their final places or close-by.

Notice that we've kept 7 of the moved keys on the same fingers as QWERTY, 2 on the same hand, and 4 have moved to the opposite hand. Even with only these changes, we're already much better than Simplified Dvorak.

The hardest changes are now behind us, keep practicing.
Don't get too comfortable, switch to **QwickStep 4** as soon as you can.

## QwickStep 4

Now we're tweaking the remaining few unsmooth letter placements. Swap `Y` with `K` and `B` with `J`.
```
 Q   W  <U> [D] <P> [K] <F> [Y] (L) (;)  [   ]   \

  A   S  (E) (T)  G   H  (N) (I) <R> [O]  '   enter

   Z   X   C   V  <J>  <B>  M   ,   .   /

Legend
    same as QWERTY
( ) same finger as QWERTY
[ ] same hand as QWERTY
< > other hand than QWERTY
```

This is already a really good layout that's better than many that are harder to learn.
Trivia: this ends up being a more optimized version of the **NIRO** layout (rotates B-K-J keys).
In fact this was the original version of **Qwickly** and we could call this the *final* version of **QwickStep**.

In the picture below note which fingers are used for which keys, in particular the left-middle finger is not used for the bottom row.

### WPM per letter on day 6

There's some evidence that reusing muscle-memory for home row keys works.<br/>
Notice which letters are more/less quickly typed than others.

### WPM progress day 2 to 6

Day 1 started at ~15 wpm after about an hour of practice.
