# Qwickly
An easy to learn keyboard layout that's fast and comfortable to type.

An installer for all macOS/OS X versions is available: [download Qwickly.dmg](https://github.com/qwickly-org/Qwickly/releases/download/v1.0/Qwickly.dmg)

## Qwickly I

Swap frequently occuring letters: `E`, `T`, `N`, `I`, `O`, `P` \
with letters above or below them: `D`, `F`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `;` \
We use `-`, `=` more than `[`, `]` so swap them too.
```
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0  ([) (])  bksp

 Q   W  (D)  R  (F)  Y   U  (K) (L) (;) (-) (=)  \

  A   S  (E) (T)  G   H  (N) (I) (O) (P)  '   enter

   Z   X   C   V   B  (J)  M   ,   .   /

Legend
    same as QWERTY
( ) same finger as QWERTY
```

## Qwickly II

Reduced finger travel for other frequently occuring letters: `R`, `U` \
rotate-swap with letters: `D`, `P`
```
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0  ([) (])  bksp

 Q   W  <U> [D] (F)  Y  [P] (K) (L) (;) (-) (=)  \

  A   S  (E) (T)  G   H  (N) (O) (I) <R>  '   enter

   Z   X   C   V   B  (J)  M   ,   .   /

Legend
    same as QWERTY
( ) same finger as QWERTY
[ ] same hand as QWERTY
< > other hand than QWERTY
```

## Qwickly

Final tweak rotate-swap letters: `K`->`Y`->`P` \
and swap letters: `J`<->`B`
```

  A   S  (E) (T)  G   H  (N) (I) (O) <R>  '   enter

   Z   X   C   V  <J> <B>  M   ,   .   /
