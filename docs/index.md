## Qwickly (step 1)

Answers the question "What's the simplest set of key changes to make QWERTY suck less?"

Let's get the 8 most [frequently occurring letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency) in home finger positions. `A` and `S` are already there.

Swap the frequently occurring letters: `E`, `T`, `N`, `I`, `O`, `P`<br/>
with the letters above or below them: `D`, `F`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `;`.

*(`R` occurs more than `P` but we'll get it in the next step)*
```
 Q   W  ·D·  R  ·F·  Y   U  ·K· ·L· ·;·  [   ]

  A   S  ·E· ·T·  G   H  ·N· ·I· ·O· ·P·  '          | Legend
                                                     |     same as QWERTY
   Z   X   C   V   B   ·J·  M   ,   .   /            | · · same finger as QWERTY
```
The keys `ASET GH NIOP` uses the same muscle-memory from QWERTY, just not moving fingers off the home row.<br/>
With this layout, you will start off missing the `DF JKL` keys but that's okay since the letter you want is just above/below the miss and very easy to find and correct. This ability makes this first step as painless as can be.<br/>
We are mostly learning the new home row. Switch to **Qwickly (step 2)** as soon as you start getting the hang of step 1.

It turns out that this is not a far-fetched idea and [another has already discovered it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JMhIDGfquU&feature=youtu.be) (youtube) and called it `SwapSix`.

## Qwickly (step 2)

Next we want `R` on the home key position and we'll shuffle `O`, `P`, `U`, and `D` as well. It may not be obvious why these were chosen. It has to do with ultimately reducing finger travel and same finger [bi-grams](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2014/09/26/bigrams.html) which are slower and less comfortable to type.

```
 Q   W  <U> (D) ·F·  Y  (P) ·K· ·L· ·;·  [   ]     | Legend
                                                   |     same as QWERTY
  A   S  ·E· ·T·  G   H  ·N· ·I· <R> (O)  '        | · · same finger as QWERTY
                                                   | ( ) same hand as QWERTY
   Z   X   C   V   B   ·J·  M   ,   .   /          | < > other hand than QWERTY
```

Here we're mainly learning the new `U`/`D` and `R`/`O` positions.<br/>
Again, switch to **Qwickly** as soon as this layout starts to get comfortable.

## Qwickly

Qwickly-1 is a solid layout in itself. We are now putting on the finishing touches.

Swap the following letters:
- `F`, `P`, `H` (rotate 3 keys)
- `K` with `Y`
- `J` with `B`
- `,` with `;` (note that the shifted `<` and `:` don't move)

```
 Q   W  <U> (D) <P> (K) ·H· (Y) ·L· (,)  [   ]     | Legend
                                                   |     same as QWERTY
  A   S  ·E· ·T·  G  <F> ·N· ·I· <R> (O)  '        | · · same finger as QWERTY
                                                   | ( ) same hand as QWERTY
   Z   X   C   V  <J>  <B>  M  (;)  .   /          | < > other hand than QWERTY
```

The main thing to learn is the new placement of `H`/`F`/`P` keys as the other changed keys don't come up as often. Having the comma so close by should be a nice perk.
